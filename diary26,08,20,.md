Today was our first day learning about “data bases”.
I'll list down below all the things I've learned during this particular course.

1. We started learning all the basics first, like: multiple people can have access to it(more importantly a “life” access), Structured filling and security of data. 

2. Then we started learning about Codd's 9 rules which were : 

Integration: consistent

Operation: saving, searching, changing, adding
Catalog: Access to data descriptions
User views: different view for different idividual
Integrity safety: accurate content
Acces control: control who gets to do what and save from unwarranted people
Transaction: all the transaction must proceed
Synchronisation: Transaction of multiple user
Data safety: saving data even when the worst case scenerio

3. Data Modeling: when learning data modeling, there are some things that are important like, Entities are represented by rectangles, Relationship are represented by a triangle, (should be an understanding verb not only: has, have, is, etc...) and Attributes are represented by an ellipse. We also learned how to connect them together properly.

4. Chen notation was named after “Peter Chen” (because computer scientist like to name stuff after them selves)
Different data types like

int(whole number)
varchar(String)
date(jjjj-mm-dd)


Keywords which are specifically identifying an entity have to be underlined.
Example: every student has his own ID number.


You can connect multiple entities to a relationship.


Differentiation of cardinalities:
Different relationships

1:1 one to one
1:N one to multiple
N:1 multiple to one
M:N multiple to multiple

Examples: 

Man is married to his wife = 1:1
Mother has children = 1:N
Workers work in a company = N:1
Teachers tech students = M:N
